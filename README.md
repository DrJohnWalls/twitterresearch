# twitterresearch
A starter kit with code for data collection, preparation, and analysis of digital trace data collected on Twitter.

**This kit complements a full-length tutorial which can be found on [SSRN](http://ssrn.com/abstract=2710146)**

# Getting Started

*There is a set of working usage examples in the file examples.py*

1.  Install requirements: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
** IMPORTANT NOTE: A new version of the peewee library has been released and breaks some APIs; take care to use the requirements file **
2.  (optional) install ipython `pip3 install -U ipython`
3.  start python
4.  Import libraries, such as `import rest, streaming`
5.  Use functions, for example:

```
archive = rest.fetch_user_archive("lessig")
for page in archive:
    for tweet in page:
        print(u"{0}: {1}".format(tweet["user"]["screen_name"], tweet["text"]))

```

## FAQ

- I'm getting unicode errors on windows, what can I do?
    Make sure that your windows install of python can print unicode characters to screen without throwing errors. If in doubt, [this library](https://anaconda.org/pypi/win_unicode_console) might help.
